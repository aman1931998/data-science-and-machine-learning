Hackathon Info: This data set is created only for the learning purpose of the customer segmentation concepts , also known as market basket analysis. I will demonstrate this by using unsupervised ML technique (KMeans Clustering Algorithm) in the simplest form.

Problem Statement: You own the mall and want to understand the customers like who can be easily converge 'Target Customers' so that the sense can be given to marketing team and plan the strategy accordingly.

Methodology used: K-Means Clustering with k-means++

Implemented using python programming language, modules used are pandas, numpy matplotlib.pyplot, sklearn.cluster.KMeans,

1. Clustering -> Segmentation using Age and Spending Score
2. Selecting N Clusters based in Inertia -> Visualization
    File: "1. Segmentation using Age and Spending Score - Selection of N clusters.png"
3. Found that n=4 is most effective
4. Predicting using 4 clusters on Age vs Spending_Score
5. Visualizing above clusters
